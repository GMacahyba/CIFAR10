# CIFAR10
Repository that contains the code to a image recognition project based off CIFAR10 dataset.
It is divided in two steps: the first one deals with the assumption that the dataset includes corrupted, non-image, mislabeled and duplicated files. So, basically, the objective is to clean the dataset and make it ready to be trained by the model.
The second one deals with image preprocessing, model creation (a CNN, in this case), and evalution of performance metrics.
The two steps output files (the first one, 5 files; the second, a single .json file).

Thank you for reading and I hope you find in it some kind of use. Any tips/suggestions are greatly appreciated!
